The lab is painful by using pointers, especially during the process to store words from user input
and using multi-level pointers to make sure we can access each wordLine later. 


While working with gdb, the way I used to make sure the correctness of my code is by printing out
each element in the each input line through multiple pointers. The break point I set is in the main. The first value I printed out is the count in each set. This step is easy. The hard part is to print out the words in where can only be accessed by deferencing 2 levels of pointers. So I only tested my program with small input line (say 1 set with 2 words in it).
