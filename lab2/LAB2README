4.The most difficult part of this lab is finding an effective way to read out the floating point from the input; 
also, keeping in track with the total value without using arrays is a little bit challenge. There are lots of things needed to
be taken into consideration to help we distinguish different parts of the floating points, such as '.', '\n','\t'. After this lab,
I got a fully understanding about how getchar() works in C language, for example, say how to go to the next character we need.
Also, I learnt a better way to debug the code by adding some printf in the code instead of debuggging it directly, which is time-consuming.

5. For the first part of the lab, I set the break point in main and every time when I entered the loop again, I print out the current total, which is updated
every time the loop runs. For other times I just enter next to let the code keep executing.
For the input provided in the lab2, the change of total is: 1.625, 44.295, 170.81, 449.31, 693.720

For the second part of the lab, the line is considered to be completed when user press enter.
